## 1. Description
A deployed HTML website that lets you add, eat, and delete burgers! It also saves your current burgers and loads them for the next time.

### Summary of functionality
- The user can add a burger to eat, eat a burger, delete an eaten burger, and still have the burgers there for them next time they start the app.
- The user interact indirectly with the database when they add/delete/etc burgers.
- I used an online database to store the data
- This app uses mySQL (database), handlebars (styling and rendering), and express (routing).

## 6. Next Steps
This is a very simple virtual burger eating app and could benefit from the following updates
- Improved UI.
- A landing page to explain what the user will do on the site.
- Add pictures and animations when adding/eating a burger (I'm hosting on Heroku though).
- The ability to log in so only you can see your current burgers.
